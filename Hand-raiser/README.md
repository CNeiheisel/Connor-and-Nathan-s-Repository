# Assisted Hand Raiser Mechanism
## General Overview
The project involved simple wiring and a switch to turn on a light powered by a set of batteries.
## How It Works
Using two 6mm jacks connected to a battery pack in a 3d printed box, wires ran through a type of tubing (rubber or pvc) and connected to a light. The light then could be turned on through any type of switch (the one we included was a simple switch to click with a hand or foot).
The battery pack is anchored in the box as well as wiring, and the box has a lid that can be easily opened and closed by sliding.
