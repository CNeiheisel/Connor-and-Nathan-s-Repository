# Laser Pointer Glasses Attachment
## General Overview
This project involved creating a 3D model of an attachment that can hold a laser pointer and attach to glasses.
## How It Works
Using two 3.5mm jacks connected to a battery pack in a 3d printed box, wires attach to the 3D printed laser pointer attachment as well as a switch.
